# What others say about me

"Hello Cyprian,
Over the past few weeks, you have been sharing feedback with the Dataquest team regarding the content, the mode of teaching, bugs, and necessary 
improvements. I have reviewed your feedback and am happy to share that we have managed to implement some of your suggestions. 
These include revising critical points (calculus), updating samples (statistics course), addressing the issues of overfitting and underfitting, 
clarifying the "magic number 35," and more. We have also addressed the slight inconsistencies you mentioned, including the issue of the identity 
matrix containing 1s on both "diagonals." We have taken note of your suggestion to incorporate visual aids when discussing complex topics, 
such as the mathematics behind PCA. This approach will be considered for future optimizations. Some screens had complex instructions, 
and you suggested making them more explicit. We greatly appreciate your effort in identifying bugs and providing suggestions for improvement. 
Your input is valuable, and we wish you the best in your learning progress."

"Hello Cyprian,
Congratulations! Your project, Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings, has been selected for the spotlight in our Dataquest Newsletter. 
As a token of our appreciation, a $20 gift card is on its way to you. Please allow 4-5 working days for processing."

"Cyprian shared two guided projects on developing a dynamic AI chatbot: in a Python script and then building a user interface. 
In these projects, Cyprian practiced his new LLM skills by creating and adjusting the ConversationManager class to experiment with various 
parameters of the chatbot, manage conversation history, work with different chatbot personas, and handle errors—and then integrating this object 
into Streamlit to develop a helpful user app."

"Cyprian shared his excellent machine learning project on Predicting Heart Disease using K-nearest Neighbours—thorough, detailed, well-presented, 
and well-structured. After his initial attempt, Cyprian improved the project by implementing feature selection with principal component analysis 
and reduced computational time with a simultaneous increase in accuracy!
Thanks a lot, Cyprian, for your enthusiasm and participation in our Community!"

"Hi Cyprian,
Congratulations on completing a guided project and thank you for sharing it with the community!
I like your project flow and findings. You provide detailed explanations of the visualization, which helps to understand the analysis and what the 
data reveals. Your graph presentation is excellent, with effective titles and clear observation notes following each graph.
I also appreciate that you included an additional Random Forest Regressor model to improve accuracy, especially since the R2 score for the 
Stochastic Gradient Descent on the Linear Regression model was poor."

"The work of Cyprian on 'Predicting the best time to go to the gym and avoid crowds' is another must-read project for its efficient data exploration 
and preparation, critical look at the intermediate findings, digging deeper and trying another model type to get more accurate results, 
and straightforward observations and conclusions—all supported by compelling plots!"

"My heartfelt congratulations on everything! I totally agree with Neha, Pastor, and Elena that your level of motivation, learning speed, 
and thorough approach to building your projects and portfolio are really impressive!!! 
Also, I can assure you that your success is based exactly on your hard work and well-deserved achievements rather than pure luck!! 
Keep up your fast pace in becoming a great data professional, we are looking forward to seeing your new posts and projects in the Community!"

"Cyprian shared another amazing machine learning project—on Predicting Employee Productivity Using Decision Tree Models. 
The work of Cyprian stands out for its detailed explanations of each step of the project workflow, thorough discussion of intermediate observations 
and the quality and accuracy of the final model, creation of compelling visualizations, and building and tuning different kinds of models to 
determine the most performing one."

"Cyprian shared yet another great project with the Community—Predicting Listing Gains in the Indian IPO Market Using TensorFlow. 
This work is an outstanding demonstration of time investment that pays off: clean code, nice figures, an in-depth understanding of the data, 
and clear explanations of all decisions create a cohesive and comprehensive data story while still recognizing pitfalls and making a path to 
further refinements!"

"Cyprian shared two versions of the Word Raider game—and he continues working on its upgrading and implementing suggestions from the reviewers. 
In the second version, Cyprian used his knowledge of recursive functions to greatly improve the project quality and demonstrated the application 
of his skills on real-world tasks!"

"Cyprian, together with our Community Moderator Alla, were of considerable help to our forum by reviewing the projects of other learners 
and giving them valuable suggestions on what can be further polished to make those works portfolio-ready."

A post about me by Dataquest: From Electrical Engineer to Data Scientist https://www.dataquest.io/learners/from-electrical-engineer-to-data-scientist/ 

I apply my experience as a former teacher, auditor and quality system manager to contribute feedback for the improvement of the lessons. 
The guys are humbled enough to acknowledge this and it has motivated me to keep sending them feedback. Well, I also send those corrections 
with humility and not as someone who knows more than others. These are the skills I acquired as a teacher and as an auditor. 
If I would have the opportunity to be in your team, I would mentor junior colleagues to be better than me and many data scientists out there!
